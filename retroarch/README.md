## Light Gun Configuration for Non-MAME Core Games

To assign the light gun configuration to the desired game, you need to copy the configuration file to the following location:

```
roms/SYSTEMNAME/ROMNAME.cfg
```

**Note:** The **ROMNAME** includes the original file extension before the `.cfg`. For example, for a ROM file named `House of the Dead 2, The (USA).gdi`, the configuration file should be named `House of the Dead 2, The (USA).gdi.cfg`.

These configurations will be used when starting this specific ROM.

For some cores, it is necessary to inform RetroArch that the devices are light guns. Follow these steps:

1. Press the B button + Home on the Wiimote to open the RetroArch menu.
2. Select the Quick Menu with the Plus button.
3. Choose Controls and then Port x Controls.
4. Set the Device Type to Lightgun.
5. Save the game remap file.

**Note:** To navigate back, use the Minus button.
